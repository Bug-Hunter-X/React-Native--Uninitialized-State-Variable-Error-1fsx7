The solution is to conditionally render the component or provide a default value for the state variable.  Here is an example of how to solve this problem by providing a default value for the state variable:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0); 

  useEffect(() => {
    //Simulate an async operation that updates the state
    setTimeout(() => {
      setCount(10);
    }, 1000);
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      {/* Conditionally render the text until the state is initialized */}
      {count !== 0 && <Text>{count}</Text>}
    </View>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

This revised code ensures the `Text` component only renders once the `count` state has a value other than 0.  Alternatively, you could use a default value during the initial render: 

```javascript
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{count || 'Loading...'}</Text> 
    </View>
  );
```
