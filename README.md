# React Native Uninitialized State Variable Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications: accessing a state variable before it has been initialized.  This leads to a runtime error: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'count')`.

## The Problem

When a React Native component mounts, its state is not immediately available. Attempting to access the state variable within the `render` method before the component has fully mounted will cause this error.  The `bug.js` file shows an example of this problem.

## The Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the state variable is initialized before it's accessed.  This can be achieved through conditional rendering or by providing a default value. The `bugSolution.js` file showcases a corrected version that handles this scenario.

## How to reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the directory `bug.js`.
3. Run the app using your preferred React Native environment.
4. You will observe the error in the console.
5. Now check `bugSolution.js` for the corrected version.
